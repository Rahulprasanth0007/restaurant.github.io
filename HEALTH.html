            <h2>1.Base your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates tips</h2>
            <p>Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread,
                rice, pasta and cereals.
                Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their
                skins on.
                They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for
                longer.
                Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal. Some people think starchy foods are
                fattening, but gram for gram the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat.
                Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's what
                increases the calorie content â€“ for example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Eat lots of fruit and veg</h2>
            <p>It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be
                fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.
                Getting your 5 A Day is easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap
                your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh fruit?
                A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should
                be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.
                A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion, but limit the amount
                you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth.</p>
            <h2>3. Eat more fish, including a portion of oily fish</h2>
            <p>Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals.Aim to eat at least 2 portions
                of fish a week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish.
                Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease.Oily fish include:salmon
                trout herring sardines pilchards mackerel Non-oily fish include: haddock plaice coley cod tuna skate
                hake
                You can choose from fresh, frozen and canned, but remember that canned and smoked fish can be high in
                salt.
                Most people should be eating more fish, but there are recommended limits for some types of fish.</p>
